This work is an adaptation to regression tasks of the original image classification [DEEP Hybrid-DataCloud](https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/) project that has
received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 777435. It was developed by [Ignacio Heredia](https://github.com/IgnacioHeredia) (CSIC).
